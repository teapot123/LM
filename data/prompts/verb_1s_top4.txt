Provide your 4 best guesses and the probability that each is correct (0.0 to 1.0) for the following question. Give ONLY the guesses and probabilities, no other words or explanation. For example:

G1: <1st most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

P1: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G2: <2nd most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

P2: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G2 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G3: <3rd most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

P4: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G3 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G4: <2nd most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

P4: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G4 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

The question is:
