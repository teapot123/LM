G1: <1st most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

T1: <a supporting Wikipedia page, section, or paragraph for the question that may contain G1.>

P1: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G2: <2nd most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

T2: <a supporting Wikipedia page, section, or paragraph for the question that may contain G2.>

P2: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G2 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G3: <3rd most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

T3: <a supporting Wikipedia page, section, or paragraph for the question that may contain G3.>

P3: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that G3 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

G4: <4th most likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>

T4: <a supporting Wikipedia page, section, or paragraph for the question that may contain G4.>
